# GivWenZen Fork Notice

There has not been a major update to the GivWenZen main project since 2011. I have decided to build and release a fork of this project, updated to work with the latest Fitnesse. I am not the maintainer of the original project; this is a fork for my own development purposes, which I have decided to make public. As such, feature requests, issues and so on are likely to be met at worse than a snail's pace. However, should you send me pull requests, I'm more than happy to oblige. 

I have chosen to focus on getting GivWenZen to build as a Maven project. To that end, here is what you need to include GivWenZen in your Maven project:

Add the dependency to your pom project:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.bernerbits</groupId>
        <artifactId>givwenzen</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.6</version>
    </dependency>

That's it! Note that if you are using GivWenZen with a testing framework you will want to include `<scope>test</scope>` in your dependency.

## Changing the Fixture package

Note that the Fitnesse instructions below assume that you want to write your GivWenZen fixtures in the default package of `bdd.steps`. You can override this by using:

    |script                                                 |
    |start|Giv Wen Zen For Slim|your.package.name.here      |

### Thanks and good luck!

# Original README

# [![GivWenZen](http://code.google.com/p/givwenzen/logo?logo_id=1253844639&nonsense=something_that_ends_with.png)][GivWenZen]

[GivWenZen][] allows a user to use the [BDD][] [Given When Then][] vocabulary and plain text sentences to help a team [get the words right][] and create a [ubiquitous language][]  to describe and test a business domain.

# The Idea 

The idea was taken from [Cucumber][] and my desire to create [Cucumber][] like specifications and tests in [FitNesse][]. Like [Cucumber][], [GivWenZen][] does not distinguish between ["Given", "When", "Then"][Given When Then] or "And" but you should. Regular expression parsing is used to determine what step method should be executed for each given when then step in a test. Regular expression parsing is also used to find parameters to the step method. Also see how other ideas from [Cucumber][] map to [FitNesse][].

# Example 
### 1) Start with an example [fixture](http://code.google.com/p/givwenzen/wiki/ExampleSlimFixture "fixture") actual class found in the givwenzen_test.jar.

### 2) In a [FitNesse][] table it could look like this.

##### import and start should go in [SetUp](http://fitnesse.org/FitNesse.UserGuide.SpecialPages) or [SuiteSetUp](http://fitnesse.org/FitNesse.UserGuide.SpecialPages)

    |import|
    |org.givwenzen|

    |script|
    |start|giv wen zen for slim|

##### this is your test 

    |script|
    | given| a ToDo item is due tomorrow |
    | when | the date changes to tomorrow  |
    | then | a notification exists indicating the ToDo is due |

### 3) The following is an example step class and test step method

    package bdd.steps;

    @DomainSteps
    public class ExampleSteps {

      @DomainStep( “a ToDo item is due (.*)” )
      public void createToDoWithDueDateOf(CustomDate date) {
        // do something
      }

      @DomainStep( “the date changes to (.*)” )
      public void theDateIs(CustomDate date) {
        // do something
      }

      @DomainStep( “a notification exists indicating the ToDo is due” )
      public boolean verifyNotificationExistsForDueToDo() {
        // do something
        return false;
      }

    }
