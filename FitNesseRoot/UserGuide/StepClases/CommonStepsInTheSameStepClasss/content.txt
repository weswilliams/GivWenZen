!5 One of the things I like about the step classes over plain fixtures is the ability to put step test methods together that deal with the same set of objects.  If you have a Catalog object you can put all the methods that call actions or verify the state of the catalog you should put the methods in a !-CatalogSteps-! class.  If you are doing web testing and you have a Search page you should have a set of test steps in a !-SearchSteps-! class.
